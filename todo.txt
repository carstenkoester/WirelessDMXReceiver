- Error handling during scan: If _radio.getChannel() != _channel, something is wrong
- Error handling during scan: Reset after a number of unsuccessful scans.. either after exhausting all 126 channels, or after exhausting sizeof(wdmxID_t) * 126 channels?

_channel++;
  if (_channel > 126) {
    _channel = 0;
    if (_configID == AUTO) {
      if (_ID < WHITE) {
        ++_ID;
      } else {
        _ID = RED;
      }
    }
  }
  return;

Reset if >126 and configID != auto, or instead of going back to RED


 - At runtime, can we check if communication with the wireless module is up?
 - Create a discrete blink code (2x blink, 1-sec dark) to indicate nRF error?
